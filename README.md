## 🔑 What is this?

Welcome to google-keys, a fun little museum of over 500+ keyboxes that somehow ended up in the open. Whether it was a rogue commit, a bad .gitignore, or a classic case of "I'll delete this later" — they’re all here!

This collection is meant to help Google employees locate and revoke these sensitive keyboxes before someone else does something... *less helpful* with them.

---

## 🧾 What's Inside?

* 🗂 500+ raw Google keyboxes
* All in this very repo, in the root directory — no subfolders, no categories, no distractions.
* All the same type (you’ll know when you see them 👀)
* No metadata, no commentary — just the goods.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Let’s clear the air:

* 🔓 The keys are not obfuscated
* 🛡 They have not been reported to Google Security (we leave that part to you, dear Googler)
* 📬 Found something that shouldn't be public? Maybe... revoke it?

This repo does not encourage misuse. It exists to increase visibility and to *hopefully* get the right people’s attention.

> Think of this as a community-powered "CTRL+F" for Google’s internal cleanup team.

## 🙃 Why Does This Exist?

Because:

* 🤦 Mistakes happen. Even at Google.
* 🧹 Token hygiene is important.
* 🕵️ Transparency makes security easier, not harder.
* 👻 It’s already out there — may as well make it easier to fix.

---

## 🤷 What Now?

If you're a Googler:

* Take a look.
* Search for your project.
* Revoke what's leaked.
* Maybe buy coffee for whoever accidentally committed it. ☕️

If you're not a Googler:

* Please don’t misuse this.
* Be responsible and wait.

## 🧙 Contributing?

If you stumble upon previously unknown Google keys (keyboxes), feel free to contribute so Google can revoke them too, so that we build a better relationship with Google and its security team.

## ❤️ Final Thoughts

This isn’t about shaming — it’s about surfacing. Security shouldn’t rely on obscurity, and secrets don’t stay secret when they’re in public repos.

> Let’s clean up the cloud, one forgotten key at a time.
